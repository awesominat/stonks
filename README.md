Our software attempts to solve the problem investors have when they want to practice investing risk-free.


## User Stories

### Team User Story (Buy use case)
As a stock investor ready to start my investment journey, I would like to buy any number of a specific stock and have 
the stocks I’ve bought saved so I don’t lose my investments. This feature will allow me to test my theories in stock 
investments so I can be better prepared when I spend my real money.

### Stephen User Story (ResetBalance use case)
As an investor who has lost all my money, I would like to reset my account so that I can start over again since the 
imaginary investments I have made through the Stonks™ app did not go as I had hoped, and I now wish to simulate other 
investment strategies.

### Zain User Story (StockInfo use case)
As an investor interested in buying a stock, I would like to view comprehensive information about that specific stock, 
such as their previous prices, current prices, and percentage change in the last day, so I can make an informed decision 
about how to spend my money.

### Ricky User Story (ViewPortfolio use case)
As a finance enthusiast worried about whether I made the right choice buying a stock, I would like an intuitive overview 
of all the stocks I am currently invested in and how they are performing. As in, I would like to see the percentage 
profit or loss for every stock I have purchased.

### Gursimar User Story (Sell use case)
As an aspiring investor who understands the stock market is changing rapidly, I would like to conveniently sell stock 
using the fake money in my portfolio and know how much I have profited/lost from what stocks (of what company) as well 
as how much money my account will have after I sell. These features are so that I can effectively track how well I am 
progressing in my investment journey.
